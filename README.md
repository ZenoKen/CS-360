The Weight Tracker app is a tool designed to help users track their weight loss progress. Unfortunately, the development of this app could not be completed due to unforeseen circumstances. However, this README will provide an overview of what the app would have included if it had been completed.
User Needs
The Weight Tracker app was intended to address the user need for a simple and easy-to-use tool to track their weight loss progress. The app was designed to allow users to set a weight loss goal, log their daily weight, and view their progress over time. The goal was to create a user-friendly interface that would make it easy for users to track their progress and stay motivated to reach their weight loss goals.
Screens and Features
Several screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app. The app would have included the following:
A login and registration screen
A home screen to display weight loss progress
A screen to set weight loss goals
A screen to log daily weight
The UI designs would have kept users in mind by focusing on simplicity and ease of use. The designs would have been successful because they would be easy to navigate, and users could quickly log their daily weight and view their progress.
Coding Approach
In terms of coding the app, standard coding techniques and strategies would have been followed, such as breaking down the app into smaller modules and using object-oriented programming principles. Various frameworks and tools would have been used to simplify the development process.
Testing
Testing would have been a critical part of the development process. The app would have been tested thoroughly to ensure that it was functional and met all user needs. This process would have been important because it would have revealed any bugs or issues that needed to be fixed before release.
Innovation
In terms of innovation, creativity would have been required when it came to designing the UI. A simple and intuitive interface would have been created that would make it easy for users to log their weight and view their progress.
Demonstrated Knowledge, Skills, and Experience
Although the app was not completed, the design of the app's UI demonstrated knowledge, skills, and experience in app development and design. An interface was created that was easy to use and navigate and addressed the target audience's needs.
Conclusion
Despite not being able to complete the Weight Tracker app, valuable experience was gained in app development and design. The importance of testing and user feedback was learned, as well as the importance of keeping the user in mind throughout the development process.
